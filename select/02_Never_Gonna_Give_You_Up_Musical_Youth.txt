What I'll give you is sweet music
Right
You take sugar and i have none
You take your coffee black and I have mine white
Life is a mystery
So let's live for today
We don't know our destiny
So lets love each other
Never gonna give you up
No matter what your mama says, girl
Cause you promised me that you'll always love me
Never gonna give you up
No matter what your papa says, girl
Cause you promised me that you'll never leave me
We dated through high school
And we have made promises to love each other
Never gonna give you up
No matter what your mama says, girl
Cause you promised me that you will always love me
Never gonna give you up
No matter what your papa says, girl
Cause you promised me that you'll never leave me

If you love somebody new
It would make me sad
But what can I do?
Love is like the wind
It comes and goes
And you are my true love
And I'll never let go
Never gonna give you up
No matter what your mama says, girl
Cause you promised me that you'll always love me

Never gonna give you up
No no never gonna give you up
