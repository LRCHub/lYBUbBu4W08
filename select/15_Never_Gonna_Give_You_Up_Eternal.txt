All my life it seems my line has been set
And this time I'm gonna play to win
'Coz here you are at my fingertips
Gonna reach right out and pull you in
It doesn't matter what you do
I'm simply gonna make you mine
Even though I cry for you
I could never break the tie
It doesn't matter what they say
I just can't get enough
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm never gonna give you up

Never gonna give you up (x3)
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up (x3)
Never gonna let you go

Never never (x4)

Mama says someday that I'll meet someone
Who will take me away from you
I guess that she just doesn't know about love
There can be no substitute
'Coz what I feel for you is strong
I simply got to make you mine
I have waited much too long
I can never let this die
It doesn't matter what they say
I just can't get enough
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm never gonna give you up

Never gonna give you up (x3)
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up (x3)
Never gonna let you go

Never never never give you up
Never never
Never never never give you up
Never never

Never, yeah

All this wanting and frustation I feel
I'm sure I'll pay the price
But I keep my dreams until I make them real
'Coz I know you're worth the sacrifice

Never gonna give you up (x3)
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up (x3)
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna (x2)
Never gonna let you go
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna (x2)
Never gonna let you go

Never gonna give you up
